# HR Form Automation

This project simplifies the HR data entry process by combining Streamlit forms, CSV storage, and Word document automation.

## ✨ Features

* **Streamlit Form** – Interactive web form for entering employee details (Name, Gender, Address, etc.)
* **CSV Export** – Automatically saves details into a CSV file for digital storage
* **Word Template Filler** – Fills predefined employee form templates by replacing placeholders (e.g., `Name: _____ → Name: Ansh`)
* **Dual Record Keeping** – Ensures both hardcopy-ready forms and digital CSV records are maintained without duplicate effort

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit** (for form UI)
* **pandas** (for CSV handling)
* **python-docx** (for Word template automation)

* A simple web form for data entry
* Automatic CSV updates
* Auto-filled employee form templates ready for printing
